    "answer": "I'm glad to help clarify this! In reality, cows do not lay eggs at all. Cow produce milk, while chickens lay eggs. Chicken eggs are much smaller compared to cow's milk. So, the farmer's wife likely used the smaller chicken eggs for breakfast, not eggs from a cow. If you have any more questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask!"
