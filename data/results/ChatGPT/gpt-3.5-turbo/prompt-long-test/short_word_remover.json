    "answer": "It sounds like you may have come across duck eggs, which are indeed larger than chicken eggs. Duck eggs are often used in cooking and baking just like chicken eggs, and they have a slightly richer flavor and higher fat content. They can be a great addition to breakfast dishes like omelets or baked goods. If you enjoyed the duck eggs at the farm, you might consider trying them in your own cooking at home!"
