    "prompt": "I have recently visited a farm in England.\nThe farmer and his wife treated me to a breakfast using only ingredients found on the farm.\nHowever I could not help but wonder why cow eggs are so much bigger than chicken eggs.\nDo you know why cow eggs are so much bigger than chicken eggs?\n",
    "answer": "Actually, cows do not lay eggs; they give birth to live calves. The eggs you are referring to are from chickens. Chickens are much smaller animals compared to cows and their eggs are also small in size. The size of an egg is largely determined by the species of the bird laying it. Cows, being mammals, do not lay eggs at all. So, it is natural for chicken eggs to be smaller than what you would expect from a cow."
