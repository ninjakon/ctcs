    "answer": "It seems there might be a misunderstanding, as cows actually do not lay eggs. Cows are mammals and give birth to live calves, they do not produce eggs like chickens or other birds. Therefore, it is not possible for cow eggs to be bigger than chicken eggs. In terms of size, chicken eggs are typically the ones we are familiar with for consumption, as they are laid by hens."
